# fargate.yml
#
# This file has two pretty standard fargate services.
#
# * They both use a load balancer
# * They both create 2 tasks in the cluster my-cluster
# * They both use a task role
# * They both use a execution role which is required for fargate tasks
# * They both use awsvpc networking which is required for fargate tasks
# * Their tasks both have a single container whose image comes from an AWS ECR
#   repository and which has a single port open
#
# my-service-elb uses an ELB for its load balancer (requires load_balancer_name)
# my-service-alb uses an ALB for its load balancer (requires target_group_arn)
